Voting Power is attained by locking SWRV tokens in the DAO.\n\nThe DAO proposals can be accessed [here](https://bafybeiaudy7h3gh2355hbpc5rrmx6n5s6ttwxphfeuxbsa5dkqojqhnnsi.ipfs.dweb.link/dao/)\n\nAll off-chain voting proposals that pass would eventually be put up for vote on DAO for finality and implementation."
